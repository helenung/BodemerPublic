								<p><strong>Year: </strong>Junior<strong> Major: </strong>Biology (Physiology)</p>
								<p>I first learned about the project last January when I saw a posting about it on the Undergraduate Research Database. I was interested in learning more about medical instrumentation so I reached out to become a part of the team. Several months later, I have learned a lot and I am excited to continue to work on the Bodemer Collection for the next few years.</p>

								<p><strong>Year:</strong> Junior<strong> Major: </strong>Biochemistry (Intended)</p>
								<p>I started this project because I was interested in bioethics as a minor. I thought this would be a good way to gain some experience with the subject that I would not be able to get in the class. It has been a lot of fun learning about old medical instruments and the history behind them. </p>

								<p><strong>Year: </strong>Sophmore<strong> Major: </strong>Biology (Intended)</p>
								<p>When I came to the University of Washington, I was looking for a fun research opportunity to enhance my knowledge of the UW and medicine. I managed to find the perfect position in the Department of Bioethics and Humanities to work with the Bodemer Collection. Not only do I get to work with amazing individuals but I also have learned so much about medical history through my research with the civil war kits and keeping up to date on my fellow colleagues research findings. </p>

								<p><strong>Year: </strong>Senior<strong> Major: </strong>Neurobiology & Psychology</p>
								<p>I started working on this project towards the end of 2013 after taking Professor Berrymanâ€™s History of Medicine class. I am a very hands-on person and am always looking for opportunities to make what I learn in the classroom come to life. This project seemed like the perfect opportunity. I have always valued history and through this project I have been able to learn more about medicine since its conception.</p>
